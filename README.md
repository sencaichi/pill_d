# Pill'd -> A Medication/Supplement Tracker App

This project is still very much a work in progress! I wanted to create an app that could help people better manage their health in a holistic way. 

## User Stories
1. The user can scroll through a horizontal calendar slider view.
2. Add medications or supplements or whatever you take that you might need to track, in terms of duration and dosage.
3. Add doses of medications that will then appear in the home screen.

## Tech Stack
1. CoreData
2. SwiftUI
