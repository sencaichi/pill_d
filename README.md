# Pill'd -> A Medication/Supplement Tracker App

This project is still very much a work in progress! I wanted to create an app that could help people better manage their health in a holistic way. 

## How to Demo: 
1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Open up the directory in Xcode.
3. Launch the app in the Simulator.

## You'll need:
1. Xcode 15
2. iOS 17

## User Stories
1. The user can scroll through a horizontal calendar slider view.
2. Add medications or supplements or whatever you take that you might need to track, in terms of duration and dosage, using a curved, animated menu. 
3. Add doses of medications that will then appear in the home screen.

## Tech Stack
1. SwiftData
2. SwiftUI
